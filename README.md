This is an unofficial third party library for the awesome [Tawk.to](https://www.tawk.to/) plartform. Since there is no official SDK for mobile, I had to leverage their direct chat link and the cool powers of webview.

## üòä Side note
The reason I made this package, even though a package, [flutter_tawk](https://github.com/ayoubamine/flutter_tawk) by [ayoubamine](https://github.com/ayoubamine/), already exists was because it hadn't been maintained in quite awhile. Plus I've been wanting to build my own package from quite some time to learn the inner workings. Hence, this package is heavily inspired by [flutter_tawk](https://github.com/ayoubamine/flutter_tawk) as can be seen in this readme and the code as well. I'm planning on keeping this package maintained till at least we get an official package. I also plan on adding further Tawk.to api's as well, so stay tuned.
